It isn't necesary to containerize this app, you can just run it from your laptop. 

But if you do want to run it in Docker, or in Kubernetes, the scripts in this container will help you do it.

Pre-requisites:
 - Install Docker Desktop locally. That will let you build a container and run it locally.
 - For Kubernetes, have access to a Kubernetes cluster, and have a container repo to host the application image.

Run scripts in sequence.
