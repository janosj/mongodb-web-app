# A basic Node.js web application built on MongoDB

Here is a very simple web "application" (just a form, really) that illustrates one of the key benefits of using MongoDB: the ability to iterate rapidly and build great apps faster. The scenario is immaterial, but let's say you're collecting data from a variety of sources and you want to then make it available to anyone who wants it. But before you do that, you want a data steward to take a look and sign off on it, verifying that it's suitable (or not) for public consumption. It's a very simple (but not unreasonable) requirement, and your lead developer decides to implement this as a simple Node.js web application (also immaterial, as MongoDB supports a dozen different languages). The point of the demo is to show how your developers can build their apps immediately, without first designing a database schema in advance, and can then make iterative changes to their application without constantly going back to the database or their DBAs to make schema modifications (as would be required by any relational database). 

**Step 1:** Launch the Node.js application and open the form in a web browser. Fill in the fields and click Submit. Note how the record looks in MongoDB (you can use MongoDB Compass side-by-side with the web form), and note that the collection did not exist until the first record was written.

**Step 2:** At this point, the developer is pleased with how easy it was to get the initial capability up and running, but now starts to think that it would have been better to have separate fields for the user's first and last names. So, they modify the web form with the additional field, reload the web page, fill in the form, and click Submit once again. Presto! The new JSON document has the new data model. No modifications necessary in MongoDB. And yet, unlike the case with simple key-value data stores, all fields are instantly queryable. You could, for example, query on "approvedBy.lastName". You can create secondary indexes, build data pipelines, run analytics, etc. Using Compass, you could also demonstrate JSON Schema validation at this point, as one way to address possible concerns about inconsistent/erroneous data models (e.g. require approvedBy.lastName).

**Setup:** **Node.js** and **npm** have to be installed. Then, from the <em>code</em> directory, run "npm install" to install the dependencies defined in <em>package.json</em>. To start the Node.js app, modify the <em>runApp.sh</em> script to use the right MDB connect URI, and then run script. The form can be accessed from a web browser at http://localhost:8081. The web form is in <em>index.html</em>. The 2 required code changes to get from v1 of the form to v2 are clearly commented in the code - just make these changes on-the-fly in the demo using your favorite code editor, save the changes, and then reload the form in your web browser. Backup versions of both v1 and v2 forms are only there in case you ever forget to undo your work at the end of the demo.
